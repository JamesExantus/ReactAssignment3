Since your projects are all taking different approaches and User stories we made  
this iteration deliverable rather simple so you can focus as much as possible on
 customziing and making the app your own! Same deliverables regardless of the 
 project you chose.

Incorporate a Form component in your app
Style the Form Component 
Refactor your component hierarchy to lift and handle State in the proper higher-level
 components refer to the lecture


 // Example we went over

const recipe = { 
  description: 'Some description',
  image: 'Some Image'
};
const recipe2 = { 
  description: 'Some description2',
  image: 'Some Image2'
};

const recipes = [recipe, recipe2];


function RecipeList({ recipes }) {
  return recipes.map(recipe => {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>{recipe.description}</p>
        <p>{recipe.image}</p>
      </div>
    )
  })
};

<SearchBar/> // <-- What does this have to do to filter?
<RecipeList/>


// <SearchBar/>
// 1. Allows user to type in some words
// 2. If words match something within recipes
//    - It will filter out recipes
//      - setFilteredRecipes(recipesFilteredByUser)
function App() {

  const [filteredRecipes, setFilteredRecipes] = useState(recipes);

  return (
    <>
      <SearchBar setFilteredRecipes={setFilteredRecipes} />
      <RecipeList recipes={filteredRecipes}/>
    </>
  )
}
